# A rochwu at https://rochwu.github.io/

I wanted to make a site to... screw with people because I could. It was mainly meant to be like a resume like thing where I just throw it at people, but the more I wrote the more mediocre it seemed. I thought it was pretty cool but then it's so basic...

BUT! Then chasing that stupid button got fun so I thought why not make it an incremental? So this resume like page, that's probably gonna be hosted on something with a cool domain name, is now an incremental!
